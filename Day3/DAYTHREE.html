It was a simple hypertext program that had some of the same ideas as the Web and the Semantic Web but was different in several important ways.">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" title="The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.">Internet</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext" title="Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access.">hypertext</a> system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia" title="An encyclopedia or encyclopaedia is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge, either general or special, in a particular field or discipline.">encyclopedia</a> is the first entry

HTML 3.2 was published as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium#W3C_recommendation_(REC)" title="The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.">W3C Recommendation</a>. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape" title="Netscape Communications Corporation was an American independent computer services company with headquarters in Mountain View, California, and then Dulles, Virginia. " target="_blank">Netscape</a>'s visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML" title="Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) is a mathematical markup language, an application of XML for describing mathematical notations and capturing both its structure and content, and is one of a number of mathematical markup languages ">MathML</a>

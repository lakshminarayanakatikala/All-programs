        Gujarati Kadhi served with Bhaat (steamed rice)
        When Barack Obama visited India he was served Gujarati kadhi.[4] Kadhi was included on the Chinese president's menu when he visited Ahmedabad.[5] Kadhi has different varieties in India, due to which Gujarati kadhi is completely different from Sindhi Kadhi, Rajasthani Kadhi pakoda,[6] Badi Kadhi or a UP Kadhi except that all are yoghurt based (except Sindhi kadhi which has a tamarind base). In Gujarat, it's served with khichdi or steamed rice.[7]
